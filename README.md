# Fast.ai course
A repository with homework that I did for fast.ai course v3 (https://course.fast.ai/index.html)

I am currently learning about deep learning, hoping to apply it to biodiversity sciences pretty soon. For those who want to do the same, I recommend the amazing course [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/index.html). Here you will find some of the homework that I did for the course:

## Lesson 1: Quick and dirty insect egg classifier

Here I just adapted some code seen in class to classify dog and cat breeds to classify an insect order based on its egg image. Egg images come from a paper I recently wrote with [Sam Church](https://shchurch.github.io), [Seth Donoughe](https://www.sethdonoughe.com) and [Cassandra Extavour](https://www.extavourlab.com). More specifically, from cropped images available in the [egg visualization tool](https://shchurch.github.io/dataviz/index.html). This was really my first time coding a neural network and I did not expect much, since images include line drawings, photographs and SEMs. Surprisingly, the classifier did a reasonably good job at guessing the insect order based on an egg image.
